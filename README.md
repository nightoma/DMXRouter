## Architecture

DMXRouter runs on a **single-threaded event-loop architecture** driven by Qt's event system. This is a deliberate design decision: crossfade calculations and merge operations complete in microseconds per tick even at high universe counts, while a multi-threaded worker queue would introduce latency through queued connections. The result is consistent sub-millisecond output timing — critical for live shows.

```

Key design invariants:

- Per-universe sequence counters (Art-Net and sACN) — compliant with Art-Net 4 §ArtDmx and E1.31 §6.2.6
- Output rate limiter (token bucket at 44 fps / 22.7 ms) — prevents receiver overload per E1.31 §6.6.1, with dirty-flag optimization to skip identical frames and keep-alive emission every ~850 ms
- Socket send/receive buffers at 2 MB — absorbs burst traffic from 40+ simultaneous universes
- Packet rate calculations normalized by actual elapsed time — eliminates jitter from QTimer imprecision under event loop load
- Defensive bounds checking throughout — stale indices and corrupted fade states produce log warnings, never visible artifacts on a live rig

---

## Protocol Support

### Art-Net 4
- Receive and transmit ArtDmx on any local network interface
- ArtPoll / ArtPollReply discovery with manual trigger (no background polling traffic on production networks)
- Remote node configuration via ArtAddress and ArtIpProg
- Multi-bind node merging (combines replies from the same IP across ports)
- Correct per-universe sequence numbering (1–255, wrapping, independent per universe)
- Paced ArtAddress command queue (20 ms between packets) to prevent node RX buffer overflow on multi-port configurations
- ArtSync frame synchronization — buffers ArtDmx and releases on ArtSync for glitch-free output, with 4-second timeout fallback
- Correct broadcast routing on dual-NIC setups — packets go out on the correct interface instead of always using the system's default route

### sACN — ANSI E1.31 2018
- Full multicast and unicast support
- Per-universe per-source priority (0x64 default, 0xDD per-channel override fully supported in merge and monitoring)
- Per-channel priority 0 correctly handled — sources with priority 0 on a slot are excluded from the merge per E1.31 §6.2.3
- **Universe Synchronization** — E1.31 Extended Sync packets (vector 0x00000001) for glitch-free multi-universe refresh on LED walls and large installations
- Universe Discovery (10-second cycle with pagination)
- Stream termination handling
- Protocol-aware sequence validation (0 is a valid wrap value in sACN, unlike Art-Net where seq 0 means "disabled")
- Self-send detection via CID — prevents processing our own multicast packets on loopback

### Cross-protocol bridging
Any input protocol can be routed to any output protocol. Art-Net → sACN, sACN → Art-Net, or same-protocol universe remapping — all configurable per route.

---

## Internal Routing

The output of one process engine can be fed as the input to another, enabling cascading merge topologies without requiring physical network loopback.

- **Engine-to-engine selection** — the merge editor lists all available engines with their output targets; selecting one automatically links the routing
- **Per-engine sender keys** — each engine's internal output uses a unique cache key, preventing collisions when multiple engines share the same output universe
- **Keep-alive propagation** — when a source drops, the upstream engine's keep-alive data continues to feed downstream engines, preventing cascading failures through the routing chain
- **Failsafe hold propagation** — hold-last-state behaviour propagates correctly through internal routing chains, including Full and Scene failsafe modes which are now forwarded to downstream engines immediately
- **Physical loopback** — for same-interface routing scenarios where the "OWN" checkbox is enabled, data is injected directly without requiring an external network path
- **Recursion guard** — maximum depth of 4 prevents infinite loops in circular topologies

---

## Merge Engine

Each merge engine accepts **up to 4 inputs** and produces one merged output. Up to **512 engines** can run simultaneously.

### Merge Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **HTP** | Highest Takes Precedence — maximum value per channel across all inputs |
| **LTP** | Latest Takes Precedence — most recently updated source wins per channel |
| **Backup** | Primary input active; secondary takes over automatically when primary times out |
| **X-Fade** | Crossfade between two sources via a DMX control channel (0 = input 1, 255 = input 2) |
| **Switch** | Select one of up to 4 inputs via DMX control values (8–15 = input 1, 16–23 = input 2…) |
| **Custom** | Per-channel merge policy — each of the 512 channels independently set to Input1/2/3/4, HTP, or LTP |
| **sACN Priority** | Merges sources using E1.31 per-channel priority values; priority 0 excludes a source from the slot |
| **Preset / Snapshot** | Startup buffer that holds the last known state across power cycles |

### Per-engine Features

- **Master / Limit** — scale the entire output (0–100%) and set per-channel hard limits
- **Source IP filter** — accept data only from specific IP addresses
- **Accept Own Data** — control whether the engine processes packets from its own output interfaces
- **Accept Preview** — discard or accept sACN preview data packets (E1.31 bit 7)
- **Startup buffer** — send a stored snapshot while waiting for live sources to appear
- **Failsafe** — configurable behaviour when all sources time out: hold last, go to black, send full, or play a recorded scene
- **Channel patch** — per-channel remap applied after merge, before transmission
- **Enable / disable** — engines can be toggled on and off without losing their configuration

---

## Show Cue System

DMXRouter includes a complete show programming and playback engine for automated lighting control.

### Recording
- Capture a snapshot of the live merged DMX output across all active process engines as a numbered cue
- Up to **40 shows**, each with an unlimited cue list
- Each cue stores per-engine DMX state (512 channels × engine count)
- Cues carry individual fade times and user labels

### Playback
- **Go** — advance to the next cue with a smooth crossfade
- **Jump** — go to any cue by index instantly
- **Back / Forward** — pre-select the next cue without triggering
- **Pause / Resume** — pause mid-crossfade; the fade resumes from exactly where it was stopped
- **Stop** — halt playback immediately and inject a blackout
- **Hold timer** — configurable auto-advance delay before the next cue fires

### Crossfade Engine
- 40 Hz update rate (25 ms tick) for smooth transitions
- Linear interpolation across all 512 channels of every active engine
- Flash-free cue jumps after a Stop state (skips the crossfade to prevent ghost-frame artifacts)

### DMX Remote Control
- Any DMX channel on any universe can trigger record, play, stop, and cue selection from a lighting desk
- Arm / disarm prevents accidental triggers on startup
- Gap guard prevents cue flooding from noisy DMX faders

## RDM & RDMNet

### RDM — ANSI E1.20
- Discover devices on any Art-Net universe (ArtRdm packets)
- Identify, set DMX start address, device label, and personality
- **Identify management** — visual 💡 indicator and amber highlight in the device tree on identify, dedicated Identify Off button in the Config tab, right-click context menu (Identify On / Off), and an **All Identify Off** panic button in the header bar that sends Identify Off to every discovered fixture
- Read 19+ PIDs: device info, manufacturer, model, personality list, DMX address, identify state, sensor definitions and values, lamp state, lamp on mode, product detail, supported parameters, and more
- PID Browser for raw GET/SET of any standard or manufacturer-specific parameter
- 3-second transaction timeout with automatic retry (up to 2 retries per transaction)
- **Sequential probing** — fixtures are queried one at a time with 50 ms spacing, preventing gateway buffer overflow on cheap Art-Net nodes and cutting probe time from 9+ seconds to ~1.5 s on large rigs
- **ACK_TIMER** — fixtures that need extra time (factory reset, firmware) are retried after their requested delay, preserving the original command class (GET or SET)
- **ACK_OVERFLOW** — fixtures with 115+ supported PIDs that split responses across multiple packets are reassembled transparently
- **Full UTF-8 support** — manufacturer, model, label, software version, personality names, slot names, and sensor names display correctly in Chinese, Korean, and other non-Latin scripts
- Full device cache with parameter persistence
- **Personality column** — "Pers" column in the device tree shows the current mode (e.g., `3/12`) at a glance
- **DMX address overlap warning** — fixtures on the same port with overlapping channel ranges are highlighted in red with a conflict tooltip
- **Stale indicator tuned for scale** — 3-minute threshold prevents healthy fixtures from greying out on large installations where keepalive cycles exceed 60 seconds
- Interactive device tree in the **🔧 RDM** tab, sorted by DMX start address with device counts per port, DMX address ranges, and last-seen timestamps
- RDM is **off by default** — toggle on via toolbar to avoid unintended bus traffic during live shows

### Fixture Templates
- Save a device's configuration (DMX address, personality, label, and parameters) as a reusable template keyed by manufacturer and model ID
- **Auto-apply on discovery** — newly discovered devices matching a saved manufacturer/model pair receive their template configuration automatically, enabling hands-free commissioning of replacement fixtures
- Templates stored as JSON and persist between sessions
- Manual apply available for selective deployment from the Templates tab

### Fixture Database
- Track operating hours, lamp hours, and power cycles for every RDM device in the installation
- Timestamped snapshots build a usage history per fixture for maintenance planning
- LED fixtures that don't support lamp hours no longer show misleading "0 hours" entries
- CSV export for integration with external asset management and maintenance scheduling tools
- Database cleanup to clear fixtures from previous sessions or venues
- Configurable minimum interval between snapshots to prevent redundant recordings

### RDMNet — ANSI E1.33 / LLRP
- **LLRP discovery** — multicast probe on 239.255.250.133 and 239.255.250.134 with known-UID suppression
- **RDM over LLRP** — send RDM commands to LLRP targets without an Art-Net path
- **Broker connection** — TCP with full Client Connect handshake, 15-second heartbeat, Client Fetch List, RPT Request/Notification/Status, and broker redirect (IPv4 and IPv6)
- CID-based packet filtering prevents processing responses intended for other controllers on the same network
- Corrupt TCP stream detection with immediate disconnect on invalid ACN headers
- Dedicated **🌐 RDMNet** tab with LLRP target list, broker controls, and client roster

---

## Channel Patching

Full channel-level remapping applied after merge and before output.

- **512-channel remap** — any input channel to any output channel
- **Scale** — multiply each channel value from 0% to 200%
- **Min / Max clamp** — hard floor and ceiling per channel
- **Bulk operations** — identity reset, channel offset, range map, pair swap, reverse, fan-out, dimmer curve
- **Presets** — save and recall patch configurations
- **CSV import / export** — compatible with standard patch sheets
- **Mini-map** — 32×16 visual overview of the complete 512-channel patch
- **Fixed-width table** — columns sized to fit numeric content with no horizontal scrolling

---

## Channel History

The universe monitor includes an **oscilloscope-style waveform display** for detailed channel-level analysis.

- **Step-style DMX trace** with gradient fill, matching the discrete nature of DMX values
- **Selectable time windows** — 5s, 10s, 30s, or 60s of history
- **Pause / resume** — freeze the view for inspection without losing incoming data
- **Hover crosshair** — shows exact value and timestamp at any point on the waveform
- **Min / max band** — dashed indicators show the value range over the visible window
- **30 FPS rendering** with smooth continuous scrolling
- **Sample deduplication** — stable channels consume minimal memory regardless of observation time

---

## Network Discovery

The **🔍 Discovery** tab shows all Art-Net nodes and sACN sources visible on the network in real time.

**Art-Net nodes:** short name, long name, firmware version, IP, port count, active universes. Remote configuration via ArtAddress and ArtIpProg directly from the UI. Dynamic port controls adapt to the actual port count reported by each node, with per-port universe display, merge mode, direction, RDM enable, output style, and protocol selection. Art-Net universes show absolute universe numbers alongside the standard Net.Subnet.Universe notation. Nodes removed 60 seconds after last reply.

**Protocol-aware port configuration** — switching a port between Art-Net and sACN adapts the addressing UI automatically: sACN hides Net/Subnet and expands Universe to 1–32,767, Art-Net shows the traditional Net / Subnet / Universe fields with a fully editable Absolute column that auto-syncs with the individual address fields. Switching preserves the displayed universe number — no manual recalculation needed.

**sACN sources:** source name, CID, IP, universe list. Sources removed 15 seconds after last packet.

**Node configuration** includes failsafe mode control (hold last state, all off, all full, playback scene, record scene) with intelligent detection of node capabilities — commands are sent even when nodes don't advertise support, with a clear tooltip advisory.

ArtPoll is **manually triggered** via toolbar button to avoid continuous background traffic on production networks.

## VLAN Management

DMXRouter provides cross-platform virtual network adapter management for production network segmentation.

### Windows (Hyper-V)
- Create / destroy Hyper-V Virtual Switch via asynchronous PowerShell
- Add and remove VLANs with configurable IDs and names
- Colour-coded VLAN table
- Adapter filtering hides system adapters (Default Switch, management NICs)
- Network diagnostics panel
- Requires: Windows administrator privileges and Hyper-V feature enabled

### Linux
- VLAN creation via `ip link` with 802.1Q tagging (`8021q` kernel module)
- IP address assignment and interface lifecycle management
- POSIX-compatible commands (no GNU-only dependencies)

### macOS
- VLAN creation via `ifconfig` with BSD-native `vlan` interface naming
- Automatic NIC configuration and IP assignment

> On all platforms, WiFi adapters, VPN tunnels, Docker bridges, and other non-Ethernet interfaces are filtered from the interface list. A clear advisory guides the user when prerequisites are not met.

---

## Statistics & Logging

The **📈 Stats & Log** tab provides live operational visibility.

**Metrics dashboard** — 8 live cards: Packets In/s, Packets Out/s, Total In, Total Out, Active Universes, Error Count, Sequence Errors, Uptime. Colour-coded green / red / grey by state. Packet rates are normalized by actual elapsed time to eliminate jitter under load.

**Throughput chart** — rolling 2-minute history (120 snapshots), rendered with QPainter. Cyan for inbound, green for outbound, semi-transparent fill, auto-scaling Y axis with smooth decay to prevent visual jumps on scale changes.

**Per-interface breakdown** — packet counts, Art-Net / sACN protocol split, error totals.

**Per-universe breakdown** — packet rates, merge operation counts, sequence errors, last-seen timestamp.

**Event log** — ring buffer of 10,000 entries, thread-safe. Captures all `qDebug` / `qInfo` / `qWarning` / `qCritical` output. Automatic category tagging (ArtNet, sACN, Transport, Merge, Discovery, Network, System). Filterable by level and category. Auto-scroll toggle, Clear button, monospace font. **Pop-out button** detaches the log into its own window — filters, auto-scroll, and live entries keep working while floating; close or click Dock to snap it back.

---

## Universe Monitor

The **📊 Monitor** tab provides a real-time view of all DMX data flowing through the system.

- **Per-interface filtering** — dropdown populated dynamically as interfaces appear, allowing inspection of specific network paths when the same universe arrives on multiple NICs or VLANs
- **Direction filter** — isolate input-only or output-only traffic
- **Protocol filter** — view Art-Net, sACN, or both
- **DMX / Priority view toggle** — switch between standard DMX levels (0–255) and sACN per-channel priority data (0xDD start code). Priority view uses a dedicated color palette: blue (low) → green (default 100) → orange/red (high/max 200). Hover shows the exact priority value and level label
- **Priority indicators** — universe list entries carrying 0xDD data show a `[P]` tag; when multiple sources disagree on priority, both values are shown (e.g., `pri:100/150`)
- **Grid view** — 32×16 channel grid with colour-coded values and amber selection highlight
- **Absolute universe display** — Art-Net universes show `0.1.0 (17)` with 1-based absolute numbering
- **Active channel count** — shows how many channels are above zero
- **Channel history** — click any channel to open the oscilloscope waveform view
- **VLAN-friendly naming** — long adapter names like `DMXRouter_VLAN200` are automatically abbreviated to `VLAN 200` for readability

---

## User Interface

### Dockable Panels
All 9 panels (Interfaces, Engines, Monitor, Cues, Stats, Discovery, RDM, Broker, LLRP) can be **detached into floating windows** — double-click any tab or drag it out. Ideal for multi-monitor setups: put the Monitor on your FOH screen, Engines on the tech desk, RDM on a tablet. Closing a floating panel snaps it back into the main window — panels are never lost. Keyboard shortcuts (Alt+1–9) work regardless of docked or floating state.

### Cross-Platform Visual Consistency
The interface looks identical on Windows, macOS, and Linux — same font (Inter), same colors, same spacing. Platform-specific adaptations happen under the hood:

- **Windows** — FreeType font engine eliminates the colored ClearType fringing on dark backgrounds
- **macOS** — stylesheet font sizes scaled for Retina displays; native file dialogs restored for Sequoia compatibility; App Nap disabled so DMX output stays active when the window loses focus; correct system monospace font (Menlo) used in all technical readouts
- **Linux** — consistent Fusion style with bundled Inter font; system monospace font (DejaVu Sans Mono) for technical readouts

---

## Configuration

All settings are saved to a single JSON file via **File → Save Config** (Ctrl+S) and restored with **File → Load Config** (Ctrl+O). The file includes: routing table, merge engine configurations, channel patches, show cues, VLAN settings, discovery preferences, and application version. The application tracks unsaved changes and prompts on close.

**Profile Manager** allows saving named snapshots of the complete configuration for quick recall during productions. Up to 40 profiles stored on disk. A profile can be pinned as **⭐ Startup Profile** to load automatically on launch instead of the last session.

**Session persistence** — enabled network interfaces, VLANs, and cue recorder state are saved independently of process engines and restored on every launch, even with no engines configured.

**Update checker** — automatically checks GitHub for new releases at startup (with a 3-second delay). Manual check available in the Help menu. Platform-specific asset detection for direct download links.

Example configuration excerpt:

```json
{
  "merges": [
    {
      "name": "FOH Merge",
      "output": { "protocol": "sacn", "universe": 1 },
      "mode": "htp",
      "inputs": [
        {
          "source": { "protocol": "artnet", "net": 0, "subnet": 0, "universe": 0 },
          "interface": "eth0:10.0.0.1",
          "priority": 100
        }
      ],
      "master": 100,
      "failsafe": "hold"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Typical Use Cases

**Protocol bridge** — receive Art-Net from a console on one NIC, output sACN to fixtures on another, or the reverse. Each interface is independently addressed.

**Console merge** — two FOH consoles sending to the same universe, merged via HTP so the highest value from either wins at all times.

**Priority backup failover** — main console at sACN priority 200, backup at 100. If the main drops, the backup takes over automatically within the source timeout window. The priority monitor shows exactly which source is winning each channel and why.

**X-Fade / media server handoff** — crossfade between a lighting desk and a media server output using a single DMX fader as the blend control.

**Multi-stage processing** — chain process engines using internal routing: first engine merges two consoles via HTP, second engine crossfades the result with a media server, third engine applies a master dimmer. No physical loopback required.

**Show automation** — record cue snapshots during rehearsal and play them back during the performance with configurable crossfade times, triggered manually, on a timer, or from a DMX control channel on the desk.

**Fixture repatching** — remap RGB → BGR for fixtures wired in a non-standard order, or offset a dimmer rack that starts at an unusual DMX address, without touching the console patch.

**Network segmentation** — receive on a production VLAN, output on a separate lighting VLAN, using DMXRouter as the bridge between segments. Cross-platform VLAN management makes this possible on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

**Large LED installation** — use sACN Universe Synchronization to ensure all universes are released simultaneously at receiver endpoints, eliminating visible tearing across a multi-universe LED wall.

**Fixture fleet management** — use RDM fixture templates to pre-configure replacement fixtures automatically on discovery, and track operating hours across the entire installation for proactive lamp and LED driver maintenance scheduling. The personality column and DMX overlap warnings catch configuration errors before they reach the stage.

**Multi-monitor control** — detach the Universe Monitor onto the FOH screen, keep the Engines panel on the tech desk, and float the RDM panel on a tablet — all running from a single DMXRouter instance.
